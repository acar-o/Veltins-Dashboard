## Country List

The original list of countries/regions introduced by 'gender.c' program remains unchanged. 
However some adjustments were made, such as separating grouped countries into aliases. 
For instance, `india` and `sri_lanka` are aliases. Same goes with `kazakhstan`, `kyrgyzstan`, `tajikistan`, `turkmenistan`, `uzbekistan`.
Some countries got second names: `macedonia` can be addressed as `north_macedonia`, `persia` as `iran`.
